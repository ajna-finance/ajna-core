- Run `brownie console`
- Install ganache-cli `npm i -g ganache-cli`

### Brownie integration tests

```bash

```

### ERC20 pool manual test

- Running following command will deploy ERC20 MKR/DAI pool
  - 1 lender funded with 1000000 DAI
  - lender deposits 100000 DAI in each bucket with 4000, 2000, 1500, 1000 price
  - 5 borrowers funded with 500 MKR each and depositing 1500 MKR as collateral (borrower1 - 100 MKR, borrower2 - 200 MKR, borrower3 - 300 MKR, borrower4 - 400 MKR, borrower5 - 500 MKR, )
  - borrower1 borrows 100000 DAI from hup (4000)
  - borrower2 borrows 100000 DAI from next hup (2000)

```bash
>>> lender, borrower1, borrower2, borrower3, borrower4, borrower5, dai, mkr, pool = run('erc20setup')
>>> mkr.balanceOf(pool)
1500000000000000000000
>>> dai.balanceOf(pool)
200000000000000000000000
>>> dai.balanceOf(borrower1)
100000000000000000000000
>>> dai.balanceOf(borrower2)
100000000000000000000000
```

# Functionality

## Bucket

- no bucket is preallocated
- each bucket contains a pointer to next bucket price
- next price pointer is updated when new deposit occurs at a price between current bucket price and next price

```code
    struct Bucket {
        uint256 price; // current bucket price
        uint256 next; // next utilizable bucket price
        uint256 amount; // total quote deposited in bucket
        uint256 debt; // accumulated bucket debt
    }
```

## addQuoteToken

- lender should provide a valid price to deposit quote token at
- can only move HUP up and never down
- no debt reallocation occurs
- if lending at a higher price than HUP then HUP is updated accordingly
- next HUP pointer is updated for each price bucket where case

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A[add quote token: amount and price] --> B{Is valid price};
      B -- No --> C[Revert];
      B -- Yes --> D[Is price > hup];
      D -- Yes --> E[Update hup] --> F{Is price > next price};
      D -- No --> F{Is price > next price};
      F -- Yes --> G[Update bucket pointers] --> I[Transfer amount from lender to pool] --> J[emit event];
      F -- No --> H[Move to next bucket]--> F{Is price > next price};
```
