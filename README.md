# Ajna contracts

The Ajna protocol is a non-custodial, peer-to-peer, permissionless lending, borrowing and trading system that requires no governance or external price feeds to function. The protocol consists of pools: pairings of quote tokens provided by lenders and collateral tokens provided by borrowers. Ajna is capable of accepting fungible tokens as quote tokens and both fungible and non-fungible tokens as collateral tokens.

## Accepted tokens:
- Fungible tokens (following the [ERC20 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)).
- Non-fungible tokens (following the [ERC721 token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721))

## Caveats:
### Token limitations
- The following types of tokens are incompatible with Ajna, and no countermeasures exist to explicitly prevent creating a pool with such tokens, actors should use them at their own risk:
  - NFT and fungible tokens which charge a fee on transfer.
  - Fungible tokens whose balance rebases.
- The following types of tokens are incompatible with Ajna, and countermeasures exist to explicitly prevent creating a pool with such tokens:
  - Fungible tokens with more than 18 decimals or 0 decimals, whose `decimals()` function does not return a constant value, or which do not implement the optional [decimals()](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#decimals) function.
### Pool limitations
- Borrowers cannot draw debt from a pool in the same block as when the pool was created.
- With the exception of quantized prices, pool inputs and most accumulators are not explicitly limited. The pool will stop functioning when the bounds of a `uint256` need to be exceeded to process a request.
### Position NFT limitations
- Position NFTs are vulnerable to front running attacks when buying from open markets. Seller of such NFT could redeem positions before transfer, and then transfer an NFT without any value to the buyer.
Ajna positions NFTs should not be purchased from open markets.


## Development
### Requirements
- `python` 3.0+
- `eth-brownie` 1.18.1+
- `ganache` 7.0+ is required.
- `foundry` aka `forge` 0.2.0+ is required.

### Foundry setup
- Install Foundry [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation)
- Install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`):
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
- To get the latest `forge` binaries, run:
```bash
foundryup
```

### Brownie setup
- Install Brownie [instructions](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

#### Brownie with Ganache
- Install Ganache
```bash
npm i -g ganache
```

#### Brownie with Hardhat
- Install Hardhat
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
- To use `hardhat` instead of `ganache`, add `--network hardhat-fork` to override the configured network

Caveats:
- Brownie does not support mining empty blocks using `chain.mine`
- Brownie does not report custom errors raised by the contract when using Hardhat

### Project Setup
- Make a copy of .env.example and name it .env. Add the values for
  - `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN` - required by brownie to verify contract sources
  - `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` - required by brownie to fork chain
  - `ETH_RPC_URL` - required by forge to fork chain
- run
```bash
make all
```

### Implementation notes
Pool external calls carry the `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent invocation from `flashLoan` and `take` callbacks.

## Documentation
Documentation can be generated as mdbook from Solidity NatSpecs by using `forge doc` command.
For example, to generate documentation and serve it locally on port 4000 (http://localhost:4000/):
```bash
forge doc --serve --port 4000
```

## Tests
### Forge tests
- run tests without the gas load tests (good for checking validity)
```bash
make test
```
- run tests with gas report, used for gas comparison of changes:
```bash
make test-with-gas-report
```
- run load tests with gas report, used for gas comparison of changes (takes longer to execute):
```bash
make test-load
```

### Brownie tests
- run integration tests:
```bash
brownie test
```
- to view `stdout` on long-running tests, use `brownie test -s`.
#### Debugging Brownie integration tests
- to drop into the console upon test failure:
```bash
brownie test --interactive
```
- From there, you can pull the last transaction using `tx=history[-1]`, followed by `tx.events` to debug.


## Contract size
To display contract code sizes run:
```bash
forge build --sizes
```
or
```bash
brownie compile --size
```

## Code Coverage
- generate basic code coverage report:
```bash
make coverage
```
- exclude tests from code coverage report:
```
apt-get install lcov
bash ./check-code-coverage.sh
```

## Slither Analyzer

- Install Slither
```bash
pip install slither-analyzer
```
- Make sure the default `solc` version is set to the same version as contracts (currently 0.8.18). This can be done by installing and using `solc-select`:
```bash
pip install solc-select && solc-select install 0.8.18 && solc-select use 0.8.18
```
- Run `analyze`

```bash
make analyze
```

## Deployment

A deployment script has been created to automate deployment of libraries, factory contracts, and manager contracts.

To use it, ensure the following env variables are in your `.env` file or exported into your environment.
| Environment Variable | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| `AJNA_TOKEN`         | address of the AJNA token on your target chain
| `DEPLOY_ADDRESS`     | address from which you wish to deploy
| `DEPLOY_KEY`         | path to the JSON keystore file for the deployment address
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`  | required to verify contracts
| `ETH_RPC_URL`        | node on your target deployment network

To run:

```
make deploy-contracts
```

Upon completion, contract addresses will be printed to `stdout`:
```
== Logs ==
  Deploying to chain with AJNA token address 0x34A1D3fff3958843C43aD80F30b94c510645C...
  === Deployment addresses ===
  ERC20  factory  0x50EEf481cae4250d252Ae577A09bF514f224C...
  ERC721 factory  0x62c20Aa1e0272312BC100b4e23B4DC1Ed96dD...
  PoolInfoUtils   0xDEb1E9a6Be7Baf84208BB6E10aC9F9bbE1D70...
  PositionManager 0xD718d5A27a29FF1cD22403426084bA0d47986...
  RewardsManager  0x4f559F30f5eB88D635FDe1548C4267DB8FaB0...

```

Record these addresses.  If Etherscan verification fails on the first try, copy the deployment command from the `Makefile`, and tack a `--resume` switch onto the end.

### Validation

Validate the deployment by creating a pool.  Set relevant environment variables, and run the following:
```
cast send ${ERC20_POOLFACTORY} "deployPool(address,address,uint256)(address)" \
	${WBTC_TOKEN} ${DAI_TOKEN} 50000000000000000 \
	--from ${DEPLOY_ADDRESS} --keystore ${DEPLOY_KEY}
```

Where did it deploy the pool?  Let's find out:
```
export ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH=0x2263c4378b4920f0bef611a3ff22c506afa4745b3319c50b6d704a874990b8b2
cast call ${ERC20_POOLFACTORY} "deployedPools(bytes32,address,address)(address)" \
	${ERC20_NON_SUBSET_HASH} ${WBTC_TOKEN} ${DAI_TOKEN}
```
Record the pool address.

Run an approval to let the contract spend some of your quote token, and then add some liquidity:
```
cast send ${DAI_TOKEN} "approve(address,uint256)" ${WBTC_DAI_POOL} 50000ether \
	--from ${DEPLOY_ADDRESS} --keystore ${DEPLOY_KEY}
cast send ${WBTC_DAI_POOL} "addQuoteToken(uint256,uint256)" 100ether 3232 \
	--from ${DEPLOY_ADDRESS} --keystore ${DEPLOY_KEY}
```
