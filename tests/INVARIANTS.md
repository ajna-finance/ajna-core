# Ajna Pool Invariants

## Collateral
- #### ERC20:  
  - **CT1**: pool collateral token balance (`Collateral.balanceOf(pool)`) = sum of collateral balances across all borrowers (`Borrower.collateral`) + sum of claimable collateral across all buckets (`Bucket.collateral`)  
- #### NFT:  
  - **CT2**: number of tokens owned by the pool (`Collateral.balanceOf(pool)`) * `1e18` = sum of collateral across all borrowers (`Borrower.collateral`) + sum of claimable collateral across all buckets (`Bucket.collateral`)  
  - **CT3**: number of tokens owned by the pool (`Collateral.balanceOf(pool)`) = length of borrower array token ids (`ERC721Pool.borrowerTokenIds.length`) + length of buckets array token ids (`ERC721Pool.bucketTokenIds.length`)  
  - **CT4**: number of borrower token ids (`ERC721Pool.borrowerTokenIds.length`) * `1e18` >= borrower balance (`Borrower.collateral`) Note: can be lower in case when fractional collateral that is rebalanced / moved to buckets claimable token ids  
  - **CT5**: token ids in buckets array (`ERC721Pool.bucketTokenIds`) and in borrowers array (`ERC721Pool.borrowerTokenIds`) are owned by pool contract (`Collateral.ownerOf(tokenId)`)  
  - **CT6**: in case of subset pools: token ids in buckets array (`ERC721Pool.bucketTokenIds`) and in borrowers array (`ERC721Pool.borrowerTokenIds`) should have a mapping of `True` in allowed token ids mapping (`ERC721Pool.tokenIdsAllowed`)  

- **CT7**: total pledged collateral in pool (`PoolBalancesState.pledgedCollateral`) = sum of collateral balances across all borrowers (`Borrower.collateral`)

## Quote Token
- **QT1**: pool quote token balance (`Quote.balanceOf(pool)`) >= liquidation bonds (`AuctionsState.totalBondEscrowed`) + pool deposit size (`Pool.depositSize()`) + reserve auction unclaimed amount (`reserveAuction.unclaimed`) - pool t0 debt (`PoolBalancesState.t0Debt`) (with a `1e13` margin)
- **QT2**: pool t0 debt (`PoolBalancesState.t0Debt`) = sum of t0 debt across all borrowers (`Borrower.t0Debt`)  
- **QT3**: pool quote token balance (`Quote.balanceOf(pool)`) >= liquidation bonds (`AuctionsState.totalBondEscrowed`) + reserve auction unclaimed amount (`reserveAuction.unclaimed`)

## Auctions
- **A1**: total t0 debt auctioned (`PoolBalancesState.t0DebtInAuction`) = sum of debt across all auctioned borrowers (`Borrower.t0Debt` where borrower's `kickTime != 0`)  
- **A2**: sum of bonds locked in auctions (`Liquidation.bondSize`) = sum of locked balances across all kickers (`Kicker.locked`);  total bond escrowed accumulator (`AuctionsState.totalBondEscrowed`) = sum of kickers locked balances (`Kicker.locked`) + sum of kickers claimable balances (`Kicker.claimable`)  
- **A3**: number of borrowers with debt (`LoansState.borrowers.length` with `t0Debt != 0`) = number of loans (`LoansState.loans.length -1`) + number of auctioned borrowers (`AuctionsState.noOfAuctions`)  
- **A4**: number of recorded auctions (`AuctionsState.noOfAuctions`) = length of auctioned borrowers (count of borrowers in `AuctionsState.liquidations` with `kickTime != 0`)
- **A5**: for each `Liquidation` recorded in liquidation mapping (`AuctionsState.liquidations`) the kicker address (`Liquidation.kicker`) has a locked balance (`Kicker.locked`) equal or greater than liquidation bond size (`Liquidation.bondSize`)  
- **A6**: if a `Liquidation` is not taken then the take flag (`Liquidation.alreadyTaken`) should be `False`, if already taken then the take flag should be `True`  
- **A7**: total bond escrowed accumulator (`AuctionsState.totalBondEscrowed`) should increase when auction is kicked with the difference needed to cover the bond and should decrease only when kicker bonds withdrawn (`Pool.withdrawBonds`). Claimable bonds should be available for withdrawal from pool at any time.  

## Loans
- **L1**: for each `Loan` in loans array (`LoansState.loans`) starting from index 1, the corresponding address (`Loan.borrower`) is not `0x`, the threshold price (`Loan.thresholdPrice`) is different than 0 and the id mapped in indices mapping (`LoansState.indices`) equals index of loan in loans array.  
- **L2**: `Loan` in loans array (`LoansState.loans`) at index 0 has the corresponding address (`Loan.borrower`) equal with `0x` address and the threshold price (`Loan.thresholdPrice`) equal with 0
- **L3**: Loans array (`LoansState.loans`) is a max-heap with respect to t0-threshold price: the t0TP of loan at index `i` is >= the t0-threshold price of the loans at index `2*i` and `2*i+1`

## Buckets
- **B1**: sum of LP of lenders in bucket (`Lender.lps`) = bucket LP accumulator (`Bucket.lps`)  
- **B2**: bucket LP accumulator (`Bucket.lps`) = 0 if no deposit / collateral in bucket  
- **B3**: if no collateral or deposit in bucket then the bucket exchange rate is `1e18`  
- **B4**: bucket LP accumulator (`Bucket.lps`) = 0 when a bucket is bankrupted
- **B5**: when adding / moving quote tokens or adding collateral : lender deposit time (`Lender.depositTime`) = timestamp of block when deposit happened (`block.timestamp`)  
- **B6**: when receiving transferred LP : receiver deposit time (`Lender.depositTime`) = max of sender and receiver deposit time  
- **B7**: when awarded bucket take LP : taker/kicker deposit time (`Lender.depositTime`) = timestamp of block when award happened (`block.timestamp`)  

## Interest
- **I1**: interest rate (`InterestState.interestRate`) cannot be updated more than once in a 12 hours period of time (`InterestState.interestRateUpdate`)  
- **I2**: reserve interest (`ReserveAuctionState.totalInterestEarned`) accrues only once per block (`block.timestamp - InflatorState.inflatorUpdate != 0`) and only if there's debt in the pool (`PoolBalancesState.t0Debt != 0`)  
- **I3**: pool inflator (`InflatorState.inflator`) cannot be updated more than once per block (`block.timestamp - InflatorState.inflatorUpdate != 0`) and equals `1e18` if there's no debt in the pool (`PoolBalancesState.t0Debt != 0`)
- **I4**: for all borrowers that are not auctioned and (`borrower.collateral != 0`) the sum of borrower debt squared divided by borrower collateral (`borrower.debt^2 / borrower.collateral`) should equal borrower collateralization accumulator (`t0Debt2ToCollateral`)

## Fenwick tree
- **F1**: Value represented at index `i` (`Deposits.valueAt(i)`) is equal to the accumulation of scaled values incremented or decremented from index `i`
- **F2**: For any index `i`, the prefix sum up to and including `i` is the sum of values stored in indices `j<=i`
- **F3**: For any index `i < MAX_FENWICK_INDEX`,  `findIndexOfSum(prefixSum(i)) > i`
- **F4**: For any index `i < MAX_FENWICK_INDEX`, `Deposits.valueAt(findIndexOfSum(prefixSum(i) + 1)) > 0`
- **F5**: Global scalar is never updated (`DepositsState.scaling[8192]` is always 0)

## Exchange rate (Margin of 1e12 - 1e16 on comparisons, dependent on amounts)
- **R1**: Exchange rates are unchanged by pledging collateral
- **R2**: Exchange rates are unchanged by pulling collateral

- **RE2**:  Reserves are unchanged by removing collateral
- **RE3**:  Reserves increase only when depositing quote token into a bucket below LUP. Reserves increase only when moving quote tokens into a bucket below LUP.

- **RE5**:  Reserves are unchanged by adding collateral token into a bucket
- **RE6**:  Reserves are unchanged by removing collateral token from a bucket
- **RE7**:  Reserves increase by 7% of the loan quantity upon the first take (including depositTake or arbTake) and increase/decrease by bond penalty/reward on take.

## Rewards
- **RW1**: Staking rewards must be less than reward cap percentage multiplied by ajna burned (`newRewards < REWARD_CAP * totalBurnedInPeriod`) for any given time period (`epoch`)
- **RW2**: Updating (recording) rewards must be less than reward cap percentage multiplied by ajna burned (`newRewards < UPDATE_CAP * totalBurned`) for any given time period (`epoch`)
- **RW3**: If a bucket has had it's exchange rate updated bucketExchangeRates mapping should be non-zero (`bucketExchangeRates[pool_][bucketIndex_][burnEpoch_] != 0`)
- **RW4**: After staking, for each bucket in the staked position `lpsAtStakeTime` should equal the position's LP (`position.lps`) in the bucket and `rateAtStakeTime` should equal the bucket's exchange rate (`Buckets.getExchangeRate()`)
- **RW5**: After staking, the Reward's manager contract should be the new owner of the position (`ERC721.ownerOf()`). Upon unstaking, The caller of unstake should be the new owner of the position (`ERC721.ownerOf()`)
- **RW5**: After unstaking or claiming rewards, `isEpochClaimed` should be equal to `true`, `stakeInfo_.lastClaimedEpoch` be equal to the current epoch and `rewardsClaimed` should be incremented by the claimed amount.
- **RW6**: Each time the bucket rate is updated the `updateRewardsClaimed` accumulator should be properly updated
- **RW7**: After unstaking or claiming rewards, if ajna has been burned over an epoch while the staker was staked they should have an increased amount in ajna balance `_ajna.balanceOf()` that matches the amount of ajna balance deducted from the contract`_ajna.balanceOf()`.
- **RW8**: After unstaking, stakeInfo's tokenId mapping should be deleted and all corrosponding values should therefore be zero'd out (`StakeInfo.ajnaPool`, `StakeInfo.lastClaimedEpoch`, `StakeInfo.owner`, `StakeInfo.stakingEpoch`, `StakeInfo.snapshots`)

## Position Manager
- **PM1**: For each position, for each bucket in the position summed LP balance == LP balance of the position manager in the underlying pool
- **PM2**: Position deposit time (`depositTime`) tracked by tokenId in PositionManager (`positions[tokenId][index]`) should always be of equal or lesser value than the PositionManager's LP at that index in the pool contract.
